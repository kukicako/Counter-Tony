            <p className="GuideText">In Game Leading is the shot caller, simple as that. A role that the team relies on to call strats, make adjustments and focus on putting the team in the best position round by round. By many, it's considered to be the toughest position. May it be cause of the amount work required outside of scrims and matches or may it be because of the mental fortitude it requires in game. Not just focus on playing your own game but also continuously focusing on picking up what the other team is doing, thinking of what to do in future rounds, setting up strats or players, and constantly thinking of ways to take advantage of the opposing team. A position that requires a lot of focus and attention where missing a small detail could cost you a round or match. Over this 7 part breakdown, I'll talk about all that I've personally done, practiced and worked on improving over my 4+ years of IGLing in League play across all divisions. I hope to give an insight into all that I've done, break down aspects of the game from my point view and give you the blueprints that I've followed to improving as an IGL. Though, no guide will make you a better automatically. It'll require you to put in effect to improve. I simply believe that the more time and effort you put into improving as an IGL, the more it'll show. I thoroughly believe the best IGLs put in the most amount of work in and out of the servers. It is not a position you can slack off and improve at.
