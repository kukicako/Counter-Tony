Whatever you want to say about it, it's single handily the most important resource you can use in so many regards as an IGL. Within this part, I'll breakdown every part of Value's poorly designed system known as the Demo. Let's begin by explaining what it is. It allows you rewatch a game you've played. You can use it in a million ways to improve as a player. While it is one of the most useful tools, it also can be one of the most boring and painful parts of improving. No different than watching game film, you would rather be on the field making a play than watching it. </p>
