            <p className="GuideText">Something I would like to talk about is a strange topic to say the least. I would like to talk about this because there still is a stigma to an extent that being an IGL allows you to slack in the fragging department. I do not believe to any extent that being an IGL allows you to be at the bottom of the scoreboard regularly. That being said, this heavily relies on the positions that you play. I tend to see a lot of IGLs playing less desired spots such as dedicated B player on Mirage, Ramp on Nuke or on the flipside as a designated bomb carrier support player on T side. With that being said, it is straight forward for a player playing a position like mentioned above to have less frags per game sometimes simply because of the lack of engagements. Though, this where I still tie in fragging as an IGL. Even if you play a bitch spot, you still need to be winning fights when they do happen and continuously putting your team in good spots. You should 100% hold yourself accountable to produce when your name is called upon.</p>
            
            <p className="GuideText">If you are playing a position that I'll call a bitch spot and you feel like you're not producing. Spend sometime watching a demo back. Look at rounds where your name was called. For example, if you play Ramp. Look specifically at rounds where they attacked ramp. Ask yourself basic questions such as "Did I put myself in a good position to win engagement" or ""
