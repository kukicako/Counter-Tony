            <p className="GuideText">I want to cover this before I begin to dive deeper into IGLing. In Game Leading is more than just being the shot caller for a team. By being the teams IGL, you assume the Leader role. The other players will look to you for guidance beyond strat calling. You control the attitude of the team. You lay the blueprints for the work ethic within the team. While also clearly controlling the strats calling and structure of the team. You have to hold yourself accountable as the IGL both in game and out of game. To be successful in my eyes, you have to comprepared day in and day out. You have to create an environment suitable for your team that allows for your teammates to learn from you, learn from their own players, learn from each other and be able to constructively citicise each other so that the team can continuously improve. By showing negatives action such as showing up late to practice, berating or criticizing players or simply being unprepared. You're setting a precidence that other players are allowed to do this. This can and will spiral into a toxic environment that won't be suitable for longterm progress or success. I will note that I believe every position and player should hold themself to these standards but I believe it begins with the leader setting the precidence so others can also follow along.

            Next thing I'll dive into here is exactly what I did for the guidelines I listed above. I always strived towards a list of goals. May it be for a single scrim or for the entire day. When it came to a days worth of scrims, a goal you could set it could be incorporating a new default for T side or trying out a specific setup for a specific buy round. This can allow you to have multiple rounds to review, see your teams mistakes over a magnitude of rounds and adjust accordingly. When it comes to a single scrim, it could be focusing in on playing T side aggressively by running quick site takes, contact plays or designed early round executes. Obviously you could do the opposite and take a slow approach. Though, this is a simple scrim goal that can take you and your team out of your confort zone and focus on improving your teams weaknesses. The point of this is that I always had a plan for my team everyday. May it be spending time in the practice server, having scrim goals or whatever it may be. I always showed my teammates that I want to use our time effciently so that we can learn something, practice something or simply strive to a goal in mind.
