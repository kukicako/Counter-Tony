            <h5>Awareness</h5>
            <p>I combined Awareness and Understanding Timings since I feel like they play with each other. If you're aware of a situation, you can use it to understand when a timing is possible to each gain information, gain ground or a potential kill. I'll speak first about awareness, give some examples of situations where being aware of what is happening is key then explain how you can use it to position yourself accordingly. Awareness relies on understanding the given situation that is directly involving you and understand the situation that doesn't directly involve you. If the opposing team is pressuring middle on mirage, you're hanging around connector, that's a situation that involves you. You have to be aware of what you're teammates are doing window and cat.</p>
            <h5>Early round timings.</h5>
            <p>There is a lot of points to make about understanding timing and just timing in general for awping. Let's start off by knowing the timings for peeking at the beginning of the round. This is crucial, you need to know that if you and the opposing teams awper takes the fastest route to an angle, who arrives there first. You can take it a step farther and learn the ideal position you want to scope in from, the angle you want to place your crosshair to shred those split seconds and give you a better advantage or cut down on the advantage that opposing awper could have by arriving to a position first. You can hop into an offline server, place a bot in the angle and practice these scenarios. I would even encourage grabbing a friend, practicing on a live target so you can get actual reps of practice so you can build a stronger muscle memory for these early round fights that can dictate an entire round.</p>
            <h5>Mid-Later round timings.</h5>
            <p>When we're talking about mid-late round timings, we're talking about likely positions the opposing teams awper may be holding from on CT or we're talking about being aware of what is happening so you can reaggress angles to gather information, shut down executes and make those crucial calls to rotate accordingly. We'll talk about </p>
