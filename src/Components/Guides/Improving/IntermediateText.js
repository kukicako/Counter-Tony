                <p>This is part 2 of a 4 part series where I will outline some specifics you should focus on learning, improving or getting into depending roughly on your current skill level. Part 1 covered the basics for beginners, this part will be designed for players in the skill range of AK to somewhere from LEM-Global but hasn't started to look into third party services. We will talk about some more specifics that was touched in the first part while beginning to speak about third party services such as Faceit and ESEA. The next part will be for people consistently in that Supreme/Global range who is starting to play on third party services. The final part will be for players who are looking to get into league play, how to get into it, talking about trying out and joining teams. </p>

                <h5>Let's talk about crosshair placement</h5>
                <p>I covered this in a previous guide here for aiming but I want to talk a bit more in depth about it here as I feel like it's a mechanic that when you begin to get real solid with it, it can vastly improve your game. The basic thing about is that you want to be aiming at head level. That's rather obvious at this level range. Though, something to take your game to the next level is having your crosshair in a position to where you want to specifically peek. To the right of this text is an image showcasing exactly what I mean. As you can see, I am coming out peeking into B site towards the dark corner. I'm mentally preparing to shoot while placing my crosshair in a spot where all I have to do is counter strafe and fire rather than having to adjust my crosshair. As the gif continues, I'm moving my crosshair to positions where the next possible enemy could be at. I went from dark to fountain to rightside newbox/first oranges to left newbox second oranges. In order, my crosshair is always in position while im swinging so if an enemy is there, I can simply just fire and focus on my aim rather than having to adjustment my crosshair. This mechanic can be used for every site on every map. At these levels, I would begin to spend time in an offline server going through each site practicing this type of crosshair placement where you're swinging out a site, clear each angle in order with accurate crosshair placement.</p>
