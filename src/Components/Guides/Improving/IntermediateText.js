                <p>This is part 2 of a 4 part series where I will outline some specifics you should focus on learning, improving or getting into depending roughly on your current skill level. Part 1 covered the basics for beginners, this part will be designed for players in the skill range of AK to somewhere from LEM-Global but hasn't started to look into third party services. We will talk about some more specifics that was touched in the first part while beginning to speak about third party services such as Faceit and ESEA. The next part will be for people consistently in that Supreme/Global range who is starting to play on third party services. The final part will be for players who are looking to get into league play, how to get into it, talking about trying out and joining teams. </p>
