                <p className="GuideTextP">One of, if not the most under respected aspect of a  great players game is his utility usage. Proper utility usage can set your team up to win rounds, take back or get advantages and help you immensely in fights. Throughout this guide, we'll cover topics ranging from basic utility knowledge and understanding to understand scenarios where proper utility usage can win you rounds. I want to speak about this because I still play with players in ESEA-Advanced who don't understand the impact a proper flash or timed molly can have. They just simply throw nades to throw nades without thinking about why. That "why" is exactly what we're going to go over and understand. Hopefully by the end of this, you'll have a greater respect for utility and potentially even learn how to use your nades more effectively.</p>

                <h5 className="GuideTextH5">Basic Utility Understanding</h5>
                <p className="GuideTextP">Before we get more in depth, I just want to break down some basic usages for each nade in case someone reading this isn't fully aware. If you feel like you have a decent understanding, move ahead to the next paragraph. If you're still rather new, please continue. First off the flashbang, this will blind enemies based off how near they are to the flash once it pops for a period of time. A common use of the flash is popping it right around a corner then having your teammate or yourself peek right after this. Commonly refered to as a popflash. The smoke grenade can block off a choke point or position for 15 seconds. It acts somewhat as a wall so to speak. The molitov/incendiary is a fire nade that deals damage to people who stands in, it lasts for 7 seconds. A common use for it to throw into a choke point to block enemies from going through it, thus buying time for your team to rotate. It can be on T side to force players out of position, cover the bomb while planted. The last is the handgrand which does damage to based off how close the nade is to the person. A common use is to shut down rushes and deal early damage. Another use is to nade a certain point or choke point at a particular time in a round where enemies may be arriving to inflict early damage with minimal risk.</p>
