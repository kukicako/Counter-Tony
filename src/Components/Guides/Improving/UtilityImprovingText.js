Proper utility usage can set your team up to win rounds, take back or get advantages and help you immensely in fights.

They just simply throw nades to throw nades without thinking about why. That "why" is exactly what we're going to go over and understand. Hopefully by the end of this, you'll have a greater respect for utility and potentially even learn how to use your nades more effectively.</p>

First off the flashbang, this will blind enemies based off how near they are to the flash once it pops and </p>
