While we haven't reached the top, we still feel like our advice and experience will help many as we continue our own quest to reach the top of the mountain. As we continue to grind, we want to share what we learn along the journey. Within our guides, you will learn what we've already experienced within our journey. We want you to see what we have done right and done wrong so it can help better you as a player ultimately.</p>

                    <h5 className="GuideTextH5">How do the guides work here on CSGOTeacher?</h5>
                    <p className="GuideTextP">Each section will have an introduction, much like the one you're reading right now. It'll give a broad introduction to the section, list off some charactistics about the positions then go into the definition of the position. What the position entails and what are some things you need to know to succeed at the position. I'll give a slight preview for each position by explaining one mistake players make while playing that position. I'll explain the mistake, a visualization or detailed description of it, how it should be done correctly and how you can look for this in your own game so you can avoid making that mistake. After that, you'll see anywhere between 2 and 5 guides more per position. These guides will cover all the important details and parts of playing that position. My goal ultimately is to help all players who are interested in learning that position, players are beginning to use that position and players looking to go from good to great at that position do so.</p>
