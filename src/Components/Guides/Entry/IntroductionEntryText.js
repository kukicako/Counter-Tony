                <p className="GuideTextP">Position that requires great aim, quick reactions, confidence, map knowledge and strong communication. All characteristics of strong entry fraggers in todays game. Throughout this guide, we will talk about each characteristic that is listed above and break down how you can improve at each one of them to ultimately become a better entry fragger. A strong entry fragging can put his team into position to win rounds without even getting kills. Someone who can run out into site, create room for the players behind you, gather information and communicate that is one example where you're putting your team into a position to win a round and I didn't even have to mention killing someone. Sometimes you'll straight up be a pawn to a strategy where you executing your job is all that is required to succeed. When you start including fragging ability, you're starting to talk about becoming a real talented entry fragger.</p>

                <h5 className="GuideTextH5">What is an Entry Fragger?</h5>
                <p className="GuideTextP">The Entry fragger is refered to the player who is first in on an execute, rush or contact play. While the job could have some variance to it, most commonly the job of the entry fragger is to get into site, that will create space for his teammates to swarm the site behind him. He will tend to be the first player to take contact with the opposing team, he needs to make sure to communicate any enemies he hears, sees or fights alongside another other imformation such as hearing people rotate, nades being thrown from the opposing side and what his intentions are if he stays alive.  </p>

            <div className="GuideTextPara">
                <h5 className="GuideTextH5">A common mistake for an entry fragger.</h5>
                <p className="GuideTextP">A mistake that I see too often with entry fraggers at all levels is not understanding the importance of creating space while entering a site. An entry might see someone briefly or hear a nade which causes him to stop. This could be the downfall of the entire round. One of the most important jobs of an entry fragger is to get out and create space for your teammates to follow you, trade you and help you swarm the site. If they can't do this, you'll find yourself and your team stuck in a rough position where nades such as flashes and mollies will destroy the round massively decreasing your chance of winning the round. An example I'll use will be Mirage A site. If your team throws smokes over A, your job as an entry fragger is to get out from ramp towards site clearing under balcony and then pushing your way up to site. Your job is not to go towards the boxes on the right side of ramp commonly refered to as "tetris" in North America. The issue with doing this is that you're hesistating to go into site, allowing time for the CTs to rotate while also creating an space for your teammates to follow you. The third issue is that you're not clearing out site, forcing engagements on your behalf rather than just simplying waiting for the opposing team to potentially throw utility at you then swing and kill you. </p>

Ultimately, an Entry fragger is more than someone whos first and takes fights. The little details we will speak about will give you a better understanding on how you can improve your entrying.</p>
